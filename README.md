# hello-world

Hi there!

My name is Katherine. I'm a software engineer passionate about code, problem solving, learning new things, cats and all New England sports. 

In my previous life I graduated with a degree in Physics, graduated from special fx make-up school, worked as a quality control chemist for a nutraceutical manufacturer, and as a regional buyer for national company in the natural products space. I was even an extra in the movie [Must Love Dogs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417001/).

This repository is a work in progress, but stay tuned for exciting projects in the works!
